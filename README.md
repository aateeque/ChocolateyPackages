Chocolatey Packages Maintained by Me
==================

The following applications are maintained by me as Chocolatey packages.  

***Disclaimer***: I have had no involvement in creating these applications, but rather simply for creating the Chocolatey Package to allow them to be installed quickly and easily using Chocolatey.

- CDBurnerXP 
- FeedDemon

If I miss an update for one of these packages, feel free to get in touch and I will get it updated.
