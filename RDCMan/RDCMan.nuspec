    <summary>RDCMan - Remote Desktop Connection Manager - manages multiple remote desktop connections</summary>
    <description>RDCMan manages multiple remote desktop connections. It is useful for managing server labs or large server farms where you need regular access to each machine such as automated checkin systems and data centers. It is similar to the built-in MMC Remote Desktops snap-in, but more flexible.
