    <releaseNotes>
    - New: Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all
    - New: When connecting to MTP devices such as the Kindle Fire HD or the Nook HD, speed up the process by ignoring some folders.
    - New: Allow changing the icons for categories in the Tag Browser. Right click on a category and choose 'Change category icon'.
    - New: Allow setting the color of all columns with a single rule in Preferences->Look and Feel->Column Coloring
    - New: MOBI: When reading metadata from mobi files, put the contents of the ASIN field into an identifier named mobi-asin. Note that this value is not used when downloading metadata as it is not possible to know which (country specific) amazon website the ASIN comes from.
