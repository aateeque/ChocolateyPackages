    <releaseNotes>
    - New: News download: Add a framework for scraping javascript heavy sites using a full WebKit browser. Used by the new recipe for time.com
    - New: DOCX Input: Add a markup analyzer that identifies and removes redundant markup generated by Word. This can result in much cleaner HTML and reductions in markup size of up to 50%
	- New: DOCX Input: Add support for theme fonts
	- New: calibredb list: Add an option to limit the number of results
	- New: Get Books: Allow stopping an in progress search. While doing a search, the Search button becomes a Stop button, and clicking on it stops the current search.
	- New: When viewing the list of jobs in calibre, display the time at which the job was started.
	- New: Conversion settings: When selecting the input/output profiles, show the profile screen size along with its description.
    - Fixed: Get Books: Fix searching using the title/author being case-sensitive and therefore sometimes not returning results if uppercase characters were used in the query.
    - Fixed: EPUB/AZW3 Output: When splitting HTML on page breaks, preserve tag structure in the split files. This fixes splitting losing some styling information for HTML files that define page breaks on deeply nested tags.
    - Fixed: DOCX Input: Fix some manual page breaks being ignored
    - Fixed: DOCX Input: Fix empty paragraphs not being rendered
	- Fixed: DOCX Input: Fix some text being underlined incorrectly. The 'none' underline style was being translated incorrectly.
	- Fixed: E-book viewer: When viewing EPUB files, ignore any encoding declarations in the HTML and assume that the HTML is encoded in UTF-8, unless decoding with UTF-8 fails. This is what the EPUB specification specifies.
	- Fixed: AZW3 Output: Fix a typo that could prevent conversion of some files
	- Fixed: calibredb list: When outputting data in columns, handle multibyte and east asian characters correctly.
	- Fixed: Get Books: Fix unable to change case of words in the title/author/keywords boxes because of completion.
	- Fixed: Fix unable to clear custom date columns using the bulk metadata edit dialog
	- Fixed: MOBI Output: Fix regression that breaks conversion of some documents
