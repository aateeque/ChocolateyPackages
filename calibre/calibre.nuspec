    <releaseNotes>
    - New: E-book viewer: Allow viewing images in the book in a separate pop-up window by right clicking on the image. Useful if you want to keep some image, like a map to the side while reading the book.
    - New: Catalogs: Allow generation of catalogs in AZW3 format. Also add more powerful configuration options to exclude books and set prefixes. See http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=187298 for details.
    - New: Generate a PDF version of the User Manual    
    - Fixed: News download: Fix broken handling of nesting for HTML 5 tags when parsing with BeautifulSoup
    - Fixed: EPUB: Handle files in the EPUB that have semi-colons in their file names. This means in particular using URL escaping when creating the NCX as ADE cannot handle unescaped semi-colons in the NCX.
