    <releaseNotes>
    - New: DOCX Input: Support linked (as opposed to embedded) images, if the linked image is found on the local computer.
    - New: FB2 Input: Add support for note and cite back references. Link pairs of type="note" and type="cite" now automatically generate the correct back reference.
	- New: When automerging books during during an add, include the author as well as the title in the report of merged books.
	- New: OS X Mavericks (10.9) breaks connecting to iTunes and iBooks on iOS devices
	- Fixed: OS X: Fix system tray notifications causing crashes on some OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) systems (those that had Growl installed at some point).
	- Fixed: OSX: Fix font size in completion popups too small on Mavericks (I hope)
	- Fixed: PDF Output: Fix rendering of some semi-transparent images. All semi-transparent images are now rendered using soft masks.
	- Fixed: MOBI Output: Fix text marked with white-space:pre-wrap causing the Kindle to break lines at arbitrary points inside words.
	- Fixed: FB2 Input: Fix a regression that broke conversion of FB2 files with paragraphs having both a style and an id attribute.
	- Fixed: TXT Input: Ensure that title tag in the generated HTML has a meaningful value.
	- Fixed: Book details panel: Fix HTML in author names and identifiers not being escaped
	- Fixed:HTML 5 parsing: Fix handling of xml:lang attributes on all elements xml:lang is now mapped to a plain lang on all elements, not just html tag.
	- Fixed: Update HTML 5 parser used in calibre (html5lib-python) to fix a few corner cases
	- Fixed: When bulk deleting formats, use a single temporary directory for the deleted files. This makes restoring them from the recycle bin a little cleaner. Also might fix the reported issue with the windows recycle bin choking on creating a large number of folders.
	- Fixed: DOCX Input: Add support for hyperlink fields that have only anchors and not URLs
	- Fixed: DOCX Input: Fix handling of multiple block level bookmarks at the same location.
	- Fixed: HTMLZ Output: Fix Htmlz does not apply inline css from body tag.
	- Fixed: Fix the restore database operation failing on windows installs with long usernames (this would cause the path to the temporary folder used to restore the database to become too long).

	- Fixed: Fix a bug with non-ascii text in the create catalog dialog
    - Improved News Source: A List Apart
