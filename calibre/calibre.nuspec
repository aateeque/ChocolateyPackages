    <releaseNotes>
    - New: Rewrite the HTML metadata parser to make it faster and more robust.
    - New: Book list: When sorting on a currently unsorted column, use the last applied sort for that column, instead of always sorting in ascending order.
    - New: PocketBook driver: Scan for books files in the entire device not just in the 'books' folder
	- Fixed: Fix a regression in 1.0 that could cause the dates in custom date-type columns to change in some timezones when using the edit metadata dialog to make unrelated changes.
    - Fixed: When replacing formats in a book with a very long title+authors on windows, calibre could leave behind the old format file, because the filename shortening algorithm has changed. Handle that case.
    - Fixed: Fix content server giving an error if you return to the top level page after using the virtual libraries.
	- Fixed: Fix calibredb not updating the running calibre instance properly in 1.0
	- Fixed: Fix a regression in 1.0 that broke splitting of multiple valued field like tags into many items during a rename.
	- Fixed: Fix a regression in 1.0 that caused an error when trying to set values for tags with the same item repeated, with different case.
	- Fixed: Fix a regression that broke downloading news when output format is set to PDF
	- Fixed: Creating a catalog with an already existing catalog in the library would cause a temporary duplicate entry in the book list. Also fix the author sort for catalogs generated in the AZW3 format not being correct.
	- Fixed: EPUB metadata: When changing the title in an EPUB 2.0 file that has multiple titles, remove the extra titles.
	- Fixed: Fix a regression in 1.0 that caused Search and Replace in the bulk metadata edit dialog to be much slower than before
	- Fixed: Fix a regression in 1.0 that caused incorrect sorting and searching on some composite columns (columns built from other columns).
	- Fixed: Fix a regression in 1.0 that prevented the moving of libraries inside calibre
	- Fixed: Virtual Library tabs: If the user activates a hidden tab via the Virtual Library button, change the name of the All Books tab to reflect the hidden virtual library.
	- Fixed: Ignore text records in the database that are damaged, instead of erroring out. Lets the rest of the data be used.
	- Fixed: Fix regression that broke calibredb catalog when sorting on the id field.
	- Fixed: HTML Input: Handle malformed OPF files when converting.
	- Fixed: Ensure that the Formats custom column (if present) is updated when a new format is created as a result of a conversion.
	- Fixed: Fix a bug in 1.0 that broke the Check Library function on computers with non-English locales.
	- Fixed: Content server: Fix blank username causing error on startup.
	- Fixed: Fix sorting of book list by multi-valued fields like tags not correct in the new backend.
