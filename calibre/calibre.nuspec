    <releaseNotes>
    - New: Conversion: Treat .docm the same as .docx files, ignoring any macros in the file.
    - New: EPUB Output: Auto convert CMYK images to RGB. Works around the inability of Adobe Digital Editions to display CMYK images.
	- New: Quickview: Add a checkbox to lock the quickview window so that it does not change while moving around in the main book list
	- Fixed: Fix number of marked books shown in the drop down menu of the Mark Books action not being updated when marked books are deleted (as opposed to being unmarked).
	- Fixed: Book list: Preserve the current column when using Ctrl+Home or Ctrl+End shortcuts
	- Fixed: Booklist: Fix using Page Up/Down keys moving book list by one row too many.
	- Fixed: Metadata download: Do not auto trim downloaded covers as trimming can sometimes have undesirable effects.
	- Fixed: Template language: Fix zero valued series indices not formatting correctly
	- Fixed: Fix a regression in 1.9 that broke bibtex catalog creation
	- Fixed: Quickview: Auto-close the quickview window when changing libraries. You have to open it again in the new library.
	- Fixed: Linux binary build: Update the bundled version of zlib to fix library compatibility on some newer linux distros that have libpng16 compiled to require newer zlib versions
    - Improved News Source: New York Review of Books
	- Improved News Source: Various Polish news sources
