    <releaseNotes>
    - New: Bulk metadata edit: Add a checkbox to prevent the refreshing of the book list after the bulk edit. This means that the book list will not be resorted and any existing search/virtual library will not be refreshed. Useful if you have a large library as the refresh can be slow.
    - New: Allow manually marking a book in the calibre library as being on the device. To do so click the device icon in calibre, then right click on the book you want marked and choose 'Match book to library'. Once you are done marking all the books, right click the device icon and choose 'Update cached metadata'
    - New: Driver for Coby Kyros MID1126
	- New: When adding formats to an existing book, by right clicking the add books button, ask for confirmation if some formats will be overwritten.
