    <releaseNotes>
    - New: Linux MTP driver: Detect devices that have MTP interfaces even if their USB ids are not known
    - New: Content server: Allow picking a random book by clicking the 'Random book' link on the start page. You can also refresh the random book page to get a new random book
    - New: E-book viewer: Add an option to hide the toolbars in the viewer window (Preferences->Miscellaneous->Show controls in the viewr preferences). You can unhide them by right clicking in the viewer window.
	- New: Kobo driver: Speedup initial connect by avoiding unnecessary update of series metadata in some situations.
	- New: Get Books: Allow the store plugins to be dynamically loaded so that future website changes of a store dont require a calibre update to fix Get Books.

	- New: Add PocketBook Pro 912 driver.
	- New: When creating/exporting epub and mobi files, add the calibre book identifier as a special field in the book's metadata. This allows third party tools to identify the book record in calibre to which the file belongs.
	- New: Wireless driver: Add support for using the book uuid as the filename
	- New: Remove the experimental tag from the subset fonts feature, since there has been only one reported problem (now fixed) with it in the two months since it was released

    - Fixed: LIT Input: Handle lit files that set an incorrect XML mimetype for their text.
    - Fixed: Catalogs: Fix 'X' being droppen from isbns on export
    - Fixed: Fix an error when editing date in the main book list and all visible dates are blank.
    - Fixed: Fix calibre-smtp using incorrect escaping for non-ascii attachment filenames
	- Fixed: Conversion: When subsetting fonts, handle multiple @font-face rules referring to the same physical font
	- Fixed: Content server: Update metadata when serving azw3 files
	- Fixed: CHM Input: Handle chm files that contain files with url unsafe filenames.
	- Fixed: Content server: Fix custom icons for top level categories incorrect.
	- Fixed: Kobo driver: When resending a file to the device, update the filesize in the Kobo db to prevent the device from deleting the file.
